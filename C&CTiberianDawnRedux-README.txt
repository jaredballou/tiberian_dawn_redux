YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED A COMMAND & CONQUER
      GENERALS ZERO HOUR MOD
COMMAND & CONQUER TIBERIAN DAWN REDUX
             VERSION 1.4
By sgtmyers88 & the C&CTD Redux Dev. Team
PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION!


Remember the original Command & Conquer? Remember all the units,
characters and themes from the game? Remember the gritty feeling
of RTS Warfare? Remember Tiberium?

Well, that classic game from the early 90's that spawned over a dozen titles
and revolutionized the RTS Gaming World has been reincarnated in the advanced
3D RTS World of the C&C Generals SAGE 3D Game Engine and looks better than ever!

All the classic units and themes are back, the original videos and music are all here too. 
As a special bonus, several of the GDI and NOD missions have been recreated in the best detail
possible. More missions will become available once they are completed! However, you can dish it
out in a skirmish or multiplayer game to your hearts content, as this Mod does work in both modes! 

This Mod also explores the "special" units and features that the first Command & Conquer shown
in the cinematics, but not in detail in-game. This includes the evolution of the subfactions
spawned from GDI and Nod with experimental units and weapons that were being developed after the
great battle where Kane was presumed dead.



SEE BELOW FOR FEATURES AND UPDATES:



:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.4 UPDATES:

 Visual optimization to the in-game graphics
 Several vehicle and structure models reworked & retextured
 Skirmish AI rebuilt and optimized for a better gameplay experience
 Skirmish AI utilizes more units and buildings
 Maps and singleplayer missions debugged/re-scripted
 Added new visual details to several units and buildings
 Tiberium spawning optimized to avoid game lag/crashes
 Balance fixes to several units and buildings
 Harvester and MCV movement speed slightly increased
 Base Defense Armor/HP increased
 Optimized water and terrain textures
 APC's and Transport Helicopters can now heal infantry
 Engineers can Disable & Repair Vehicles
 New RailGun Base Defense for Talon Subfaction (replaces Artillery Platform from v1.3)
 New Laser Turret for Black Hand Subfaction (replaces Flame Turret from v1.3)

 In order to resolve AI issues with the Conyard built Tiberium Refinery that disabled the
 Harvesters ability to automatically collect Tiberium and return it to the Refinery,
 the Harvesters will no longer be automatically spawned to harvest Tiberium. There is now
 a button available at the Refinery that you can click on to spawn the Harvester. 
 NOTE: If you forget to deploy the harvester you may recieve a EVA notification about it.
 Strangely enough, if you build a Tiberium Refinery using the MCV as a Dozer, the bug does
 not occur.

:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SPECIAL NOTE: If you have not figured out how the Conyard System works you will have to click
 on a button specifically labeled "Activate Conyard System" in the Conyard menu to activate it. 
 The deployment buttons are simply labeled "Deploy Conyard" (found in the MCV build menu) and 
 "Undeploy Conyard" (found in the Conyard build menu). Use caution however as you can
 "suicide" your forces in a Skirmish/Multiplayer game by clicking "Undeploy Conyard"
 with no other buildings constructed. Doing this will end the game in defeat for you!
 This is a scripting issue that could not be resolved.

;Description of crate contents in Multi-player mode. (taken from original game)
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Here is a brief explanation of the contents of crates.


      MONEY          Random.  Can be in any amount up to $5,000.

      NUKE MISSILE   Equivalent of nuclear strike using Temple
                     of NOD. One shot only.

      REVEAL MAP     Uncovers the entire map for the player.  This
                     applies to the radar screen, as well as the
                     onscreen map.

      STEALTH        Will stealth any unit that discovers this
                     crate, as well as all units and structures
                     within a 50 foot radius.

      EXTRA UNITS    Random.  Can be any GDI or NOD unit.

      HEAL ALL       Heals all of your units and structures to 100%
                     health.

      ION CANNON     Equivalent of ion cannon using the Advanced
                     Communication Facility. One shot only.

      NUKE STRIKE    Directs a Nuke Strike against the location of
                     the crate retrieved.   Very bad.

      BOMB           Explodes on contact.   Not good.

      HIDE MAP       Hides the entire map, except for your units.

      VISCEROID      Releases a Tiberium-spawned Visceroid into the
                     playing field.   Attacks randomly.


   If your base is completely gone, there's a chance you can make a
   quick comeback! You must have at least $2,500 and no base structures
   of any kind left on the map. ( base defenses may be exempt) There is a
   chance that the next crate you find will contain an MCV!


:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETTING UP & FINDING HAMACHI ONLINE NETWORK ROOMS FOR THE MOD:


1.) Download Hamachi on any site available (use Google for best results)
2.) Install and follow the configuration instructions with the program.
3.) Then once you see how Hamachi functions create or join a public Mod
network under this ID series:

ROOM: CCTDRDXROOM001
PSWD: CCTDRDXROOM001

and so on... 

There is a limit of how many users are allowed into a Hamachi room so you
will likely have to make multiple rooms if they are not already created.
You can of course make your own designated rooms but you will have to tell
other users how to access it. But if you want a public room it is best to
stick with the following network ID configuration described above for easy
access. 

However, you can still use Generals Online as the Beta Testing team has
been quite successfull playing the Mod through there as well.



:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO MAKE MANUAL ADJUSTMENTS IN-GAME FOR THE ADVANCED SHADERS:

While the Mod Launcher will allow you to choose between playing
the Mod with or without the advanced shaders and effects. 
If you choose to start the Mod with them enabled. you can still toggle
the use of the shaders in-game by using SHIFT+F12 or SHIFT+F9 on your keyboard.
When you disable the shaders you can still see some of the special effects
and it may make the environment appear excessively foggy or washed out.
This can be corrected by going to the options menu and turning your
brightness down. The best results are seen when you set the slider adjustment
bar to around 4-8 notches. (the number of little green blocks highlighted) 
You will then be able to notice the effects more clearly and it may actually
look almost as good as if the Shader 2.0 Mod was actually enabled.



:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.): (with sgtmyers88's own personal responses)

Q1.) Is this Mod for both C&C Generals and the expansion C&C Generals Zero Hour?
A1.) No this Mod is ONLY compatible with the EXPANSION C&C Generals Zero Hour.

Q2.) Will this Mod finally include a Launcher?
A2.) Yes it will indeed. I have assembled a simple launcher system that will let you
choose between playing Zero Hour and Tiberian Dawn Redux and it even includes an option
for starting the WorldBuilder map editing tool for both Zero Hour and the Mod! So feel
free to make as many Tiberian Dawn Redux maps as you like while working on the ones from
Zero Hour too! Or perhaps you have a desire to be converting maps between the two?
Why yes you can!

Q3.) Will my computer be able to handle the new graphics?
A3.) While the graphics is indeed a nice new feature that we have added to Zero Hour and
to the Mod, the most important thing we focused on was the gameplay. That was the purpose
of Mod version 1.0 thru 1.2. The idea was that we wanted to assemble and lay out the overall
playstyle of the original C&C which included an improved version of the Classic Conyard System
first seen in the C&C All Stars Mod for Zero Hour. At a later date, we finally made the effort
to make the graphics better while fixing many things from previous versions including several
bugs and balance issues found in the Mod's gameplay. This is what version 1.3 will bring to the
table this year.

For this new version, you may indeed need to have a PC that is less than 8 years old to get
the best and smoothest visual gaming experience from this Mod and a multicore processor with
a dedicated graphics card is a must. You could easily say that this Mod is closer to the C&C3
level of system requirements than you would for Zero Hour. After testing the LOD Settings on
Zero Hour and C&C3, I do think that it is a good way to grade these new Mod graphics for
determining how well you will be able to run the Mod. Do not fret, You will have an option
in our new launcher that will disable these effects to bring the Mod to a level closer to
Zero Hour settings so those of you with older systems will still be able to play this Mod
efficiently with decent graphics from the new terrain, models and textures. We want to make
sure everyone can have a fair chance at experiencing this Mod and that nobody gets left in
the dust or in the dark because their PC is not powerful enough.

Q4.) Is this Mod using stuff (e.g. models) from C&C Renegade?
A4.) Yes it is, during initial development of the Mod, I was still new to model making
and/or being a 3D Artist, so I had used some W3D Models from C&C Renegade that
were mostly bug free, I did like several of the models used and that is why
I wanted to stick to using some of the Renegade Models. However, other models
were from various sources and many more were actually made and converted by
myself and other development team members.

(Most of the Renegade Content has been replaced in later releases.)

Q5.) Why does the Tiberium Refinery and the Silos not hold and regulate Tiberium
collected like they did in the classic games?
A5.) I did not know how to find the proper coding to recreate that system.
(Concluded that it is not possible in the ZH SAGE engine.) So to
make up for that, I made the buildings act like the Black Markets and Oil
Derricks in C&C Generals Zero Hour which periodically generate extra income.
Also, the Tiberium Silos will also give you a large financial bonus when captured
by an Engineer.

Q6. Why are the Engineers allowed to be re-used and are unable to steal the Harvesters
docked inside the Refinery?
A6.) This was another tough issue that was not totally resolved... I had to
use both the C&C Generals capture building system and the GLA Hijacker system, as
I wanted to keep the Tech Buildings in the Mod, as Hijack apparently cannot be
used on neutral or non enemy buildings. I also used the Kill Pilot system that
Jarmen Kell uses so Harvesters can be captured as well. I had to use this
combination since I could not find proper game code that would allow the capture
of docked units in a recently captured building.

Q7.) Will this Mod recreate the original story campaigns?
A7.) Yes to an extent, we currently have several GDI missions and Nod Missions
completed from the original game which have been designed and scripted in incredible
detail. We also have one GDI and one Nod mission which are totally new, but they are
based on popular missions featured in the Covert Operations Expansion and from the
extra missions featured in console versions of the original Command & Conquer.
We are continuing to do our best to work on completing the rest of the missions
for future versions of the Mod. (18 in total in current release)

Q8.) Since this Mod will include a remake of the original missions, will the branching
system that enables the player to be able to choose the mission/story path?
A8.) Unfortunately, I have not found a good method in the ZH campaign system.
I am still exploring this issue and I hope a development will be made!
