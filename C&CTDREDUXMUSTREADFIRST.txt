CONGRATULATIONS ON SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOADING THE MOD! 
IF YOU HAVE NOT INSTALLED THE MOD YET, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING
PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS AND WARNINGS!



:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER:

THIS MOD HAS BEEN TESTED ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMPUTERS AND HAS WORKED SUCCESSFULLY! 
JUST ENSURE TO INSTALL THE MOD'S FILES IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS C&C GENERALS ZERO HOUR! 
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE C&C THE FIRST DECADE YOU MAY NEED TO CHECK YOUR INSTALLATION DIRECTORY 
TO FIND YOUR PROPER ZERO HOUR GAME DIRECTORY. IF A DIALOG BOX POPS UP DURING INSTALLATION 
ASKING YOU TO OVERWRITE FILES, JUST CLICK "YES" OR "YES TO ALL", THIS WILL ENSURE THAT 
ALL THE MOD FILES ARE SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED! 
ALSO MAKE SURE THAT ZERO HOUR IS PATCHED TO VERSION 1.04! 

FAILING TO TAKE THESE STEPS IS THE #1 CAUSE IN SYSTEM ERRORS AND
USER CONFUSION WITH INSTALLING AND PLAYING THE MOD!


:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
	
HELPFUL ADVICE: Even though this mod does include a simple launcher
system that should not interfere much with your Zero Hour Game Installation,
I always suggest to make a backup copy of the original directory files and 
put them in a safe place. In the case that the uninstall program fails, you can 
revert back to the standard game settings by deleting this mod and then copying 
and pasting the original settings back into the game directory, just as you had 
left it originally.

You can also use your copied Zero Hour Folder to install the mod to it. This will 
allow you to play the mod along with your original Zero Hour game as the installer 
will identify the copied generals.exe file and make a special shortcut on your 
desktop to run the mod.

With that done, You can now run the installation program and follow the on screen 
instructions for installing the Mod.
